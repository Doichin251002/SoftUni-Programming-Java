			<h1>Penguin</h1>
			
			<p>Penguins are a group of aquatic flightless birds from the order <strong>Sphenisciformes</strong> of the
				family <strong>Spheniscidae</strong>. They live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere: only one
				species, the Galápagos penguin, is found north of the Equator. Highly adapted for life in the ocean
				water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage and flippers for swimming. Most penguins feed
				on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life which they catch with their bills and swallow whole
				while swimming. A penguin has a spiny tongue and powerful jaws to grip slippery prey.</p>
			<p>They spend about half of their lives on land and the other half in the sea. The largest living species is
				the emperor penguin <em>(Aptenodytes forsteri)</em> on average, adults are about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall
				and weigh 35 kg (77 lb). The smallest penguin species is the little blue penguin
				<em>(Eudyptula minor)</em>, also known as the fairy penguin, which stands around 30–33 cm (12–13 in)
				tall and weighs 1.2–1.3 kg (2.6–2.9 lb). Today, larger penguins generally inhabit colder regions, and
				smaller penguins inhabit regions with temperate or tropical climates. Some prehistoric penguin species
				were enormous: as tall or heavy as an adult human. There was a great diversity of species in
				subantarctic regions, and at least one giant species in a region around 2,000 km south of the equator
				35 mya, during the Late Eocene, a climate decidedly warmer than today.</p>

				<h3>Etymology</h3>
				
				<details open>
					<summary><strong>Penguin</strong></summary>
					<p>The word <em>penguin</em> first appears in literature at the end of the 16th century.
						When European explorers discovered what are today known as penguins in the Southern Hemisphere,
						they noticed their similar appearance to the great auk of the Northern Hemisphere and named them
						after this bird, although they are not closely related.</p>
					<p>The etymology of the word <em>penguin</em>  is still debated. The English word is not apparently
						of French, Breton or liish origin (the latter two are attributed to the French word pingouin),
						but first appears in English or Dutch.</p>

					<summary><strong>Pinguinus</strong></summary>
					<p>Since 1871, the Latin word <em>Pinguinus</em> has been used in scientific classification to name
						the of the great auk (<em>Pinguinus impennis</em>, meaning "plump or fat without flight
						feathers"), which became extinct in the mid-19th century. As confirmed by a 2004 genetic study,
						the Pinguinus belongs in the family of the auks <em>(Alcidae)</em>, within the order of
						the Charadriiformes.</p>
					<p>The birds currently known as penguins were discovered later and were so named by sailors because
						of their physical resemblance to the great auk. Despite this resemblance, however, they are not
						auks, and are not closely related to the great auk. They do not belong in the Pinguinus,
						and are not classified in the same family and order as the great auk. They were classified in
						1831 by Charles Bonaparte in several distinct genera within the family Spheniscidae and order
						Sphenisciformes.</p>

				<h3>Systematics</h3>
				
				<p>The number of extant penguin species is debated. Depending on which authority is followed, penguin
					biodiversity varies between 17 and 20 living species, all in the subfamily Spheniscinae. Some
					sources consider the white-flippered penguin a separate <em>Eudyptula</em> species, while others
					treat it as a subspecies of the little blue penguin, the actual situation seems to be more
					complicated. Similarly, it is still unclear whether the royal penguin is a separate species or
					merely a color morph of the macaroni penguin. The status of the rockhopper penguins is also unclear.</p>

							<li><strong>Emperor penguin</strong>, <em>Aptenodytes forsteri</em>
								<p class="description">King penguins mainly eat lanternfish, squid, and krill. On foraging trips, king penguins
									repeatedly dive to over 100 metres, and have been recorded at depths greater than
									300 metres.</p>

							<li><strong>Chinstrap penguin</strong>, <em>Pygoscelis antarcticus</em>

								<p class="description">Gentoo penguins can reach a length of 70 to 90 cm (28 to 35 in),

									penguin and the king penguin).</p>

								<p class="description">It is the largest living penguin to breed on the mainland of
									New Zealand and the fourth or fifth-heaviest living penguin going on body mass.
									Males at around 5.53 kg (12.2 lb) on average are somewhat heavier than females at
									an average of 5.13 kg (11.3 lb).</p>

							<li><strong>Waitaha penguin</strong>, <em>Megadyptes waitaha</em> (extinct, disputed)
								<blockquote class="description">"The fact we find these bones in archaeological sites,

				<h3>Habitat</h3>
				
				<p>Although almost all penguin species are native to the Southern Hemisphere, they are not found only
					in cold climates, such as Antarctica. In fact, only a few species of penguin actually live so far
					south. Several species live in the temperate zone; one, the Galápagos penguin, lives as far north
					as the Galápagos Islands, but this is only made possible by the cold, rich waters of the Antarctic
					Humboldt Current that flows around these islands. Also, though the climate of the Arctic and
					Antarctic regions is similar, there are no penguins found in the Arctic.</p>
				<p>Major populations of penguins are found in Angola, Antarctica, Argentina, Australia, Chile, Namibia,
					New Zealand, and South Africa. Satellite images and photos released in 2018 show the population of
					2 million in France's remote Ile aux Cochons has collapsed, with barely 200,000 remaining, according
					to a study published in Antarctic Science.</p>
