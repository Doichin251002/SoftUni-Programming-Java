		<p>Penguins are a group of aquatic flightless birds from the order <strong>Sphenisciformes</strong> of the
			family <strong>Spheniscidae</strong>. They live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere: only one
			species, the Galápagos penguin, is found north of the Equator. Highly adapted for life in the ocean
			water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage and flippers for swimming. Most penguins feed
			on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life which they catch with their bills and swallow whole
			while swimming. A penguin has a spiny tongue and powerful jaws to grip slippery prey.</p>
		<p>They spend about half of their lives on land and the other half in the sea. The largest living species is
			the emperor penguin <em>(Aptenodytes forsteri)</em> on average, adults are about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall
			and weigh 35 kg (77 lb). The smallest penguin species is the little blue penguin
			<em>(Eudyptula minor)</em>, also known as the fairy penguin, which stands around 30–33 cm (12–13 in)
			tall and weighs 1.2–1.3 kg (2.6–2.9 lb). Today, larger penguins specieslly inhabit colder regions, and
			smaller penguins inhabit regions with temperate or tropical climates. Some prehistoric penguin species
			were enormous: as tall or heavy as an adult human. There was a great diversity of species in
			subantarctic regions, and at least one giant species in a region around 2,000 km south of the equator
			35 mya, during the Late Eocene, a climate decidedly warmer than today.</p>

			<h3 class="main-section-title">Etymology</h3>
			
			<details open>
				<summary><strong>Penguin</strong></summary>
				<p>The word <em>penguin</em> first appears in literature at the end of the 16th century.
					When European explorers discovered what are today known as penguins in the Southern Hemisphere,
					they noticed their similar appearance to the great auk of the Northern Hemisphere and named them
					after this bird, although they are not closely related.</p>
				<p>The etymology of the word <em>penguin</em> is still debated. The English word is not apparently
					of French, Breton or liish origin (the latter two are attributed to the French word pingouin),
					but first appears in English or Dutch.</p>
			</details>

				<summary><strong>Pinguinus</strong></summary>
				<p>Since 1871, the Latin word <em>Pinguinus</em> has been used in scientific classification to name
					the of the great auk (<em>Pinguinus impennis</em>, meaning "plump or fat without flight
					feathers"), which became extinct in the mid-19th century. As confirmed by a 2004 genetic study,
					the Pinguinus belongs in the family of the auks <em>(Alcidae)</em>, within the order of
					the Charadriiformes.</p>
				<p>The birds currently known as penguins were discovered later and were so named by sailors because
					of their physical resemblance to the great auk. Despite this resemblance, however, they are not
					auks, and are not closely related to the great auk. They do not belong in the Pinguinus,
					and are not classified in the same family and order as the great auk. They were classified in
					1831 by Charles Bonaparte in several distinct species within the family Spheniscidae and order
					Sphenisciformes.</p>

			<h3 class="main-section-title">Systematics</h3>
			
			<p>The number of extant penguin species is debated. Depending on which authority is followed, penguin
				biodiversity varies between 17 and 20 living species, all in the subfamily Spheniscinae. Some
				sources consider the white-flippered penguin a separate <em>Eudyptula</em> species, while others
				treat it as a subspecies of the little blue penguin, the actual situation seems to be more
				complicated. Similarly, it is still unclear whether the royal penguin is a separate species or
				merely a color morph of the macaroni penguin. The status of the rockhopper penguins is also unclear.</p>

			<h3 class="main-section-title">Habitat</h3>
			
			<p>Although almost all penguin species are native to the Southern Hemisphere, they are not found only
				in cold climates, such as Antarctica. In fact, only a few species of penguin actually live so far
				south. Several species live in the temperate zone; one, the Galápagos penguin, lives as far north
				as the Galápagos Islands, but this is only made possible by the cold, rich waters of the Antarctic
				Humboldt Current that flows around these islands. Also, though the climate of the Arctic and
				Antarctic regions is similar, there are no penguins found in the Arctic.</p>
			<p>Major populations of penguins are found in Angola, Antarctica, Argentina, Australia, Chile, Namibia,
				New Zealand, and South Africa. Satellite images and photos released in 2018 show the population of
				2 million in France's remote Ile aux Cochons has collapsed, with barely 200,000 remaining, according
				to a study published in Antarctic Science.</p>
